## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our project will be an ecommerce site for selling movies. Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application, each with their own profile page. Users will be able to browse all movies with sorting and filtering capabilities. Users will also be able to search for movies containing search terms. Movie data will be pulled from a public movie API to provide stardardization of data. Movie data will be pulled into our own internal database allowing us to add additional necessary data. Users will be able to select movies to view more information about the movie, as well as, add any movies to a shopping cart. In the shopping cart page they will be able to submit a purchase button that will return an order confirmation in window.
